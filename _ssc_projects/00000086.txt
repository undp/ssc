The initiative benefited Ivory coast more but the Governance programme (the Access to Justice programme and the Rwanda National Police Project in particular) was used as a case study for learning purposes. In addition to this, it is worth noting that the Rwanda National Police has learned a lot from the exchange.  After the first learning visit, Ivory coast initiated SMS Polling (UN TEAMWORKS).
