The study tour contributed to improving capacities of the Forest Department to conserve and sustainably manage forest resources, as evidenced from the post-study questionnaire. Learning the Turkish experience was also critical for the process of establishment of training centres in forest management in 3 regions of Azerbaijan that is among the key results achieved in 2014 under this Outcome.
