Staff members from both offices have participated in workshops in both countries on innovation and are currently working with RBEC in developing an inter-regional challenges competition.  A result of the cooperation between NGOs from both countries has been the successful proposal to the Mahallae challenges by two organizations from Cyprus and Egypt, for the development of a mobile game that support volunteerism, called i-Vee.
