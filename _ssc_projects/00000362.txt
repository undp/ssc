Following the study tour the Office of the Ombudsperson kick-started the process of bringing stakeholders and responsible parties to discuss the structure of the Ukrainian National Strategy on Human Rights which was later picked by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine who chaired the process and through establishment of a number of thematic working groups (of which UNDP was member of) ensured the development of the first draft of the National Strategy for public discussion.
