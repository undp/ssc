Following the GoPNGâ€™s engagement with other Government officials and other representatives at the workshop, as well as the NHDR publication, Dep. Of National Planning and Monitoring decided to undertake a final MDG Progress Report and sub-national HDI mapping, and requested UNDP for technical support. Further, immediately after the event, GoPNG revived and convened the National MDG Working Group.
