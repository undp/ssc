UNDP supported Public Service Reform using best practices and expertise of other developing countries that have functioning public performance management systems. UNDP facilitated the exchange & analysis of models of Kenya on public sector reform, specifically on the performance management system in public service.  After analysis, a Kenyan expert from GoK was selected to support the GoL to implement the performance management system (initially as Gov2Got support, then longer term consultancy). The performance management system, as a result of the South-South knowlege exchange and capacity buidling, was developed and approved for the Lesotho civil service, modeled after the Kenya experience. As a result, the Performance Agreement Frameworks (similarly as done in Kenya) have been signed off by 23 of 24 Cabinet Ministers.
