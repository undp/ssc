The project organized a mid-term review and an independent evaluation including assessment of reports and interviews with all stakeholders. Community-based disaster management approaches and increased engagement with China was seen as very relevant to all participating countries. Around a thousand individuals participated in project related consultations, meetings and workshops. Workshops were highly rated by participants and there is some evidence that learning is being put into practice.
