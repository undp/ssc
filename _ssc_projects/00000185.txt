Enhanced awareness on the IRBM system, its challenges and factors for success amongst government officers resulted in the identification of a sub-sector (Export Agriculture and Plantations) through which the IRBM system will be piloted. As a result, the government is in the process of developing an integrated sectoral strategic plan and budgeting model piloted in this sector.
