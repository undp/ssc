The help of Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras in India was sought by UNDP to help in the development of the Coastal Engineering courses delivered at the University of Mauritius. Through the Adaptation Fund Board project, the local university was put in touch, with UNDP facilitation, with IIT Madras for the development of specialised Masters levels courses. The UNDP project paid for the development of the handbooks and the visits to Mauritius by the Indian Experts. The short courses will be used to develop an MSc Course on Coastal Engineering to be delivered at the university of Mauritius as from 2015.
