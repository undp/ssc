UNDP supported a study tour. Based on the value perceived by the Egyptian delegation, South Africa was invited to participate in a follow-up international Conference in Egypt on Gender and Electoral Administration. Riding on this success the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) of South Africa formally sent a request to the CO to provide further institutionalized support for similar SSC in the future.
