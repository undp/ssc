This project strengthened south-south cooperation between Indian and Chinese think-tanks on low-carbon policy research and reached policy makers responsible for the 5-year plans in each country through its presentation at the high-profile ‘Third Strategic Economic Dialogue’ between China and India. It influenced the Asia Development Bank to launch a Technical Assistance Project on low-carbon development in China and India.
