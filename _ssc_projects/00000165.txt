The stocktaking exercise on the countryâ€™s international development cooperation produced recommendations that were adopted in the draft National Medium Term Development Plan 2015-2019 (E45 RPJMN 2015-19 Book II; E109 SSTC Review). The NCT-SSTC Secretariat has improved coordination by having better information and knowledge sharing among members with well documented follow-up actions. It has become the hub for SSTC initiatives for development partners.
