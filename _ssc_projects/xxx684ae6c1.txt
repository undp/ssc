project_title:  Programme-based budgeting (PBB) within the context of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
scale: regional
project_objective: Due to  high levels of public debt and excessive budget deficits, which constrained the fiscal space to expand social and development spending,  the Ministry of Finance and Economic Empowerment (MoFEE) in Mauritius introduced  PBB as an integrated approach to change the focus of the budgetary process from an input-based annual activity to a performance-based exercise that improves the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures and lays the foundations for the modernisation of public financial management.

Through UNDP's facilitation and technical support,  the sharing  of Mauritius experience in intergrating a Programme-based budgeting approach and in setting up tools to improve the efficiency of social expenditure with senior budget and planning was shared with  Malawi and the Gambia in. The delegation from Malawi received organizational and financial support from UNDP Malawi. As a result of the South-Sout exchange visits, a Pilot PBB was launched in March 2014 by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development in Malawi (E49 - Pilot PBB Malawi). Its structure is directly inspired from the PBB framework developed in Mauritius.
