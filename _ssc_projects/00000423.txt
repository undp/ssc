The project reinforced the successful transfer of the MDGs monitoring system and of methodologies in the Mesoamerican area with El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic . It also supported development of a regional results report (currently being finalized) and the establishment of the Mesoamerican Network on MDGs, a key factor for continued regional cooperation beyond project duration (E82 AMEXCID).
