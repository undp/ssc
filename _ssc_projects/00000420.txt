Regional participants shared their countries experiences/backgrounds related to the topic area. Findings from the workshop evaluation shows the increased the capacity of the participants to respond to these situations.  The training highlighted the need for Jamaica in 2015 to develop national guidelines on Hostage Negotiation and Extortion based on best practices. Further evaluation in 2015 will follow up with participants to see how they have utilized the skills gained from the workshop.
