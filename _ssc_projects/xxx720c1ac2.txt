"11": "The major objective was to gain experience from the pineapple and coffee platforms in Costa Rica and Guatemala respectively which UNDP facilitated both study tours. The Ethiopian Minister of Commerce, through the visits, tried to see how policy initiatives and regulations on quality enhancement and sustainability of coffee export could be addressed through the establishment of a coffee platform. The initiative helped Ethiopia to get a better understanding of the role of national coffee platforms including best practices of such platforms that contribute to ensure productivity, quality, sustainability and traceability of coffee. The government expressed keen interest on fostering this type of south-south cooperation to facilitate replication of well established mechanisms."
