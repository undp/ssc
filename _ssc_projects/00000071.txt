Through UNDP's technical expertise and faclilitation of knowlege exchanges between Mauritius and the Seychelles, helped the Seychelles Energy Commission gather information on capacity building, technical and legal aspects of PV. Following the visit, the Seychelles Institute of Training developed a course for PV installers.   The legal framework for the implementation of Grid connected PV is already in place as a result of the exchange initiatives.
