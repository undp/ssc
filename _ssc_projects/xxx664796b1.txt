The conceptual basis for the Virtual Center of Excellence was prepared and persons participated in a regional workshop in El Salvador to share Mexico’s experience regarding REDD +. At present, the business plan for the Center is being drawn up and will serve as a basis for making progress with the political negotiations. The project has been reflected in AMEXCID workshops and a publication on UN support for Mexico’s South-South cooperation efforts (E85 PNUD).
