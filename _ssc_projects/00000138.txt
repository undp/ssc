The city of Gazipur prepared a field-level implementation plan to introduce a one-stop social service centre, replicating the prototype developed during the exchange (Gazipur Minutes 2014). The prototype has been endorsed by the mayors of five cities. The service centres will provide a central location for public service delivery, reducing waiting times and increasing accessibility to the urban poor.
