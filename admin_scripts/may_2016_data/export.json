The exchanges enhanced the capacity of the various institutions participating in thee study tours in affording exposure, forging partnerships, drawing lessons and learning best practices, with potential to be applied in Liberia. Since their return for example, the members of the CRC have spearheaded a public consultations exercise countrywide collecting views of citizens. The image of the police is changing as a result of exposure to client-oriented policing. Seventeen police officers (13 male and 4 female) were trained in Ghana for 8 weeks.  The initiatives enhanced the capacity of the CRC and the Liberia national police through the knowledge gained and partnership forged, learning best practices to be applied to the country\u2019s development agenda.  As an end result of the exchanges the CRC was able to conclude public consultations in all 73 electoral districts reaching over 8,000 persons. It was also able to complete its report and framework for the national constitutional conference planned in 2015.",

      "2_Brief description" : "For Africa, the question of inequalities is critical, especially in light of the conversations about structural economic transformation and the optimistic outlook about the continent\u2019s prospects. Against this background and in the context of both the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 visioning and the United Nations-led post-2015 development agenda process, there is need to create a constructive space where key African constituencies which are concerned with different domains of the inequality question and/or are engaged in conceptualizing and shaping possible trajectories for African transformation can coalesce to share their visions and aspirations and explore possible common paths to social change. The planned pan-African Conference on \u201cTackling Inequalities and Promoting Structural Transformation in Africa\u201d scheduled for April 28-30, 2014 in Accra is a first step in this regard. The Conference responds to the call by the African Union (AU) Chairperson for everyone from every sector of society to have a say in defining \u201cthe African agenda for 2063\u201d.\nIt aims at forging linkages between the ongoing African developmental debates and the discussions on a post-MDGs development framework. The Conference will lead to a statement on \u201cThe Africa We Want\u201d as an input to the global deliberations on \u201cthe World We Want\u201d. Its primary intention is to craft an African agenda on inequalities, especially in the context of the pan-African process aimed at shaping an African vision for the next 50 years \u2013 i.e. the Africa 2063 agenda. It also draws from and feeds into the post-2015 development agenda discourses. The Conference and broader movement that may be generated through its preparatory and follow-up processes should catalyse a new coalition of African individuals and institutions that can foster a vibrant agenda for equitable African transformation.",

PBB is an integrated approach, which has changed the focus of the Mauritian budgetary process from an input-based annual activity to a performance-based exercise with a key objective: improving expenditure efficiency and effectiveness by systematically linking funding to results through the use of performance information. Embedded in a 3-year Medium Term Expenditure Framework, PBB is aimed at allocating public resources in line with government\u2019s priorities and improving the performance orientation of the budget process.\n\nThe PBB reform has received continuous technical support from UNDP since the preparatory phase in areas such as designing the reform; preparation of all the necessary legislative changes (e.g. modification of Finance and Audit Act); adapting the information management system to be able to measure execution of budget under the PBB format; formulation of the PBB Manual (which is part of the financial regulations); working directly with the Ministries to design their programmatic structure and the training of over 800 civil servants.",

The project proposal has been developed with the Zambian Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Development, China\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology and the advice of stakeholders from government, the private sector and research institutions in Zambia and China.\nThe project aims to support the access to electricity for rural communities in Zambia. It will do so through the creation of an enabling environment to up-scale renewable energy technology deployment. This includes removing market barriers for introduction of improved renewable energy technologies and the strengthening of South \u2013 South Cooperation between Zambia and China.  The project seeks to achieve three strategic outcomes; i) Strengthen the enabling environment for the transfer and use of priority renewable technologies in Zambia, ii) Remove market barriers to the adoption of renewable technologies for the rural poor in Zambia, and iii) Invigorate the Chinese capacity for South \u2013 South Cooperation on renewable energies.\nThe project will include support for the development of an appropriate regulatory framework for promoting renewable energy in Zambia, the development of financing options for renewable energy, the establishment of demonstration and testing facilities to showcase renewable energy technologies and build capacity.\n",
