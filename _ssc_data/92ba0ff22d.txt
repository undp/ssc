Since the project is falls under the IBSA framework, UNDP had to facilitate a working relationship and co-operation between IBSA members and Sierra Leone and advancing South-South cooperation. Given that some of the IBSA members, such as South Africa, went through some of the challenges that Sierra Leone has undergone, UNDP can assist the government in drawing upon lessons from both its successes and failures and best practices as it makes it through its post-war construction and development.
